abstract: We present an image translation approach to generate augmented data for
  mitigating data imbalances in a dataset of histopathology images of colorectal polyps,
  adenomatous tumors that can lead to colorectal cancer if left untreated. By applying
  cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGANs) to a source domain
  of normal colonic mucosa images, we generate synthetic colorectal polyp images that
  belong to diagnostically less common polyp classes. Generated images maintain the
  general structure of their source image but exhibit adenomatous features that can
  be enhanced with our proposed filtration module, called Path-Rank-Filter. We evaluate
  the quality of generated images through Turing tests with four gastrointestinal
  pathologists, finding that at least two of the four pathologists could not identify
  generated images at a statistically significant level. Finally, we demonstrate that
  using CycleGAN-generated images to augment training data improves the AUC of a convolutional
  neural network for detecting sessile serrated adenomas by over 10{%}, suggesting
  that our approach might warrant further research for other histopathology image
  classification tasks.
